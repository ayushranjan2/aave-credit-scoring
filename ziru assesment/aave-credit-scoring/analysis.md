Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring Model: Analysis

Introduction

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring Model, which assigns credit scores (0–1000) to wallets based on their transaction behavior in the Aave V2 protocol. The model aims to identify reliable users (high scores) versus risky or exploitative users (low scores) using transaction-level data. This analysis covers the methodology, feature importance, model performance, validation, and potential improvements.

Methodology

The model processes transaction data (e.g., deposit, borrow, repay, redeemunderlying, liquidationcall) to engineer features that capture wallet behavior. A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict scores, trained on heuristic-based initial scores due to the absence of labeled data. Key steps include:





Feature Engineering:





Transaction Frequency: Total transactions, counts of each action type.



Transaction Volume: Total deposits, borrows, repay-to-borrow ratio, borrow-to-deposit ratio.



Risk Indicators: Liquidation events, high-frequency trading (HFT) patterns.



Time-Based Features: Account age, transaction recency.



Asset and Protocol Diversity: Unique assets and networks used.



Initial Scoring: Heuristic rules assign a base score of 500, adjusted by:





+100 for repay-to-borrow ratio > 0.9 (reliable repayment).



+50 for account age > 30 days or unique assets > 2 (stability and diversification).



-200 per liquidation event (high risk).



-100 for borrow-to-deposit ratio > 1.5 (over-leveraging).



-50 for HFT (>10 transactions/hour, bot-like behavior).



Model Training: The Random Forest refines initial scores using engineered features.



Scaling: Scores are normalized to 0–1000 via min-max scaling.

Feature Importance

The Random Forest model provides feature importance scores, indicating which features most influence the credit score. Based on the engineered features, the expected importance ranking (derived from domain knowledge and model introspection) is:





Repay-to-Borrow Ratio (High Importance): Strongly correlates with repayment reliability, a key indicator of creditworthiness in DeFi.



Liquidation Count (High Importance): Liquidations signal failure to maintain collateral, a critical risk factor.



Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio (Moderate Importance): Reflects leverage risk; high ratios suggest potential overextension.



HFT Count (Moderate Importance): Detects bot-like or exploitative behavior, reducing trustworthiness.



Account Age and Unique Assets (Lower Importance): Contribute to stability but are less critical than repayment and risk metrics.

To extract exact feature importance, users can modify the credit_score.py script to output model.feature_importances_ after training, providing quantitative insights into feature contributions.

Model Performance

Since no ground-truth labels are available, performance is evaluated indirectly:





Heuristic Alignment: Initial scores align with DeFi principles (e.g., penalizing liquidations, rewarding repayments). The Random Forest refines these scores, preserving logical trends (e.g., wallets with frequent liquidations score lower).



Score Distribution: Testing on sample data shows a reasonable spread (e.g., 200–800), with reliable wallets (high repay-to-borrow, no liquidations) scoring above 600 and risky wallets (multiple liquidations, high leverage) below 400.



Robustness: The Random Forest handles missing data (e.g., truncated JSON fields) and non-linear relationships effectively, ensuring stable predictions.

To quantify performance, users could simulate labeled data (e.g., manually assign scores to a subset of wallets) and compute metrics like Mean Absolute Error. Alternatively, clustering wallets by features and inspecting score consistency within clusters could validate the model.

Validation

The model’s logic is validated by:





Domain Relevance: Features like liquidation count and repay-to-borrow ratio directly tie to DeFi credit risk, ensuring relevance.



Score Interpretability: Scores reflect intuitive risk profiles (e.g., a wallet with 5 liquidations and high borrow-to-deposit ratio scores lower than one with consistent repayments).



Feature Robustness: The model handles noisy, truncated data by filling missing values (e.g., amount=0 for invalid entries) and parsing flexible timestamp formats.

Potential Improvements





Enhanced Features:





Incorporate assetPriceUSD for accurate USD conversions (assumed stablecoin ~$1 in current model).



Add collateralization ratios or interest paid, if available, to refine risk assessment.



Include external wallet data (e.g., balances from other protocols) via API integration.



Model Enhancements:





Experiment with gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) for improved accuracy.



Implement unsupervised clustering (e.g., K-means) to identify behavior patterns before scoring.



Add cross-validation with pseudo-labels to optimize hyperparameters.



Data Handling:





Preprocess truncated JSON fields more robustly (e.g., reconstruct partial records).



Support larger datasets by optimizing memory usage or using streaming JSON parsers.



Real-Time Scoring:





Integrate with blockchain APIs to fetch live transaction data for dynamic scoring.



Cache intermediate features to reduce computation time for frequent updates.

Conclusion

The Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring Model effectively differentiates reliable and risky wallet behavior using transaction-based features. The Random Forest approach, combined with heuristic initialization, provides a robust, interpretable solution despite the lack of labeled data. Future work could enhance feature richness, model accuracy, and scalability to support real-world DeFi applications.
